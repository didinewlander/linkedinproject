# Before we start

Although this is an open-source project, there will be no contributers to this project, just me, sorry.

## About this project

This project is meant to be an example of my skills building a web app using the **MERN** model and deploying the app with a hosting service.

The topic of this project is a website for my Yeshiva which I've learned there a few years ago and still what to create something for them.

This will be my log report procceeding through the project.
